	 <h1>Understanding Time Space and Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that describes the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the time it takes to run as a function of its input size. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity to improve performance.</p>
    
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires as a function of its input size. It is often expressed using Big O notation, such as O(n), to describe how memory usage grows with input size.</p>
